# Kaija Schilde DoD Contracts Project

If your project has multiple teams add changes (code, deliverables, data, etc.) to your team folder.

Create a new branch from dev branch, add changes to your team folder (on the new branch you just created).

Open a Pull Request to your dev. Add your PM and TPM as reviewers.  ***Do not delete any team folders.***

At the end of the semester during project wrap up open a final Pull Request to <code>main</code> from dev.
